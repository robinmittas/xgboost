# XGBoost
Within this repository, you can find a short review paper `XGboost_Review.pdf` about XGBoost, its hyperparameters, and how to optimize them using Bayesian Optimization. The application of XGBoost and Bayesian Optimization using `Hyperopt` is showcased on a small dataset in the notebook `XGBoost_multi_log_reg.ipynb`.
